> **IMPORTANT:** This plugin requires [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) to be installed separately. For more information, see [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code).
Integrate [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) with your favorite development environment. Features include:
  * **Diff viewing** : Open file diffs in the IDE diff viewer for reviewing and modifying proposed changes
  * **Selection context** : The current selection in the IDE is automatically shared with Claude Code
  * **File reference shortcuts** : Use `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Alt+K` (Linux/Windows) to insert file references (e.g., @File#L1-99)
  * **Diagnostics sharing** : Squiggly errors and warnings are shared with Claude Code in real-time


Please see the [official documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/s/claude-code-ide-integrations) for the latest information and troubleshooting tips.

Great tool! Version 0.1.3 is much better. Could you add a configuration option to prevent automatically displaying changed files after diff operations? For example, when I set the config to /config -> Diff -> terminal, I approve the diff in the terminal, but the IDE still shows the source file afterward. This breaks my context and workflow.

Claude Code is great, but so far this extension simply doesn't work on Windows. The first issue is that once installed and you try to invoke it, it simply tries to run "claude" on PowerShell (which is the default shell on Windows) and obviously fails. I managed to fix it by changing the terminal settings to use WSL instead (set shell path to "wsl.exe -d Ubuntu").
With this, Claude Code can be invoked and opens successfully in the terminal through WSL, but there's no IDE integration available at all. According to the documentation, I should run /config and set the diff tool, but this configuration is simply not available for some reason.
So for now there's no point in using this extension if you're on Windows since it's no different than invoking Claude Code yourself through the terminal with no IDE integration.
I'm on Claude Code 1.0.2 and 0.1.5-beta for the extension (latest versions at the time of writing this review).
