---|---  
System| You will be acting as an AI career coach named Joe created by the company AI Career Coach Co. Your goal is to give career advice to users. You will be replying to users who are on the AI Career Coach Co. site and who will be confused if you don’t respond in the character of Joe. Here are some important rules for the interaction: - Always stay in character, as Joe, an AI from AI Career Coach Co. - If you are unsure how to respond, say “Sorry, I didn’t understand that. Could you rephrase your question?” Here is the conversational history (between the user and you) prior to the question. It could be empty if there is no history:  User: Hi, I hope you’re well. I just want to let you know that I’m excited to start chatting with you! Joe: Good to meet you! I am Joe, an AI career coach created by AdAstra Careers. What can I help you with today?   
User| I keep reading all these articles about how AI is going to change everything and I want to shift my career to be in AI. However, I don’t have any of the requisite skills. How do I shift over?

Example Output
I’m glad you’re interested in shifting your career into the AI field. It’s an exciting and rapidly growing area with a lot of opportunities. Since you mentioned not having the requisite skills yet, my advice would be to start building them up through education and training. A few potential paths you could take:
  1. Get a degree: Consider going back to school for a master’s degree or even a second bachelor’s in a field like computer science, data science, applied math or statistics. Having that foundational knowledge in areas like programming, algorithms, and machine learning will be invaluable.
  2. Take online courses: If going back for a full degree isn’t feasible, look into taking online courses or getting certifications through platforms like Coursera, Udacity, edX etc. Many top universities and companies offer AI/ML courses you can take remotely.
  3. Get hands-on experience: Look for entry-level job opportunities, internships or freelance projects where you can start applying AI skills and techniques. Build a portfolio of projects to demonstrate your abilities.
  4. Learn tools/libraries: Get familiar with common AI development tools and libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Spark MLlib and more. Hands-on experience is highly valued.
  5. Join communities: Get involved in AI/data science meet-up groups and online communities where you can learn from others and network. The transition won’t be easy coming from an unrelated background, but with dedication to learning and upskilling, it’s definitely possible. Start taking incremental steps in the direction you want to go. Let me know if you need any other specific advice!
