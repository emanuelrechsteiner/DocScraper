# Crawl4AI Developer Guide

## 1. Overview and Purpose

Crawl4AI is a powerful web crawling framework designed to facilitate the extraction of data from websites. It provides a robust set of features that enable developers to build efficient and effective web scraping solutions.

### Core Functionality and Purpose
Crawl4AI allows users to automate the process of navigating web pages, extracting content, and managing sessions. It is particularly useful for tasks such as data collection, web archiving, and content analysis.

### Key Capabilities and Limitations
- **Capabilities:**
  - Supports headless browsing for faster operations.
  - Allows for proxy usage to manage IP rotation and geo-testing.
  - Can capture PDFs and screenshots of web pages.
  - Provides SSL certificate retrieval for compliance and debugging.

- **Limitations:**
  - May require handling of complex web structures.
  - Compliance with robots.txt rules must be respected.

### Target Use Cases
- Data scraping for research or analytics.
- Monitoring website changes over time.
- Archiving web content for future reference.

## 2. Technical Implementation

### Architecture and Design Patterns
Crawl4AI is built on an asynchronous architecture that leverages Python's asyncio library. This design allows for efficient handling of multiple concurrent requests, making it suitable for large-scale web scraping tasks.

### Component Interactions
The main components include:
- **AsyncWebCrawler**: The core class responsible for executing crawl operations.
- **BrowserConfig**: Configuration settings for the browser instance, including proxy settings.
- **CrawlerRunConfig**: Settings that dictate how the crawler operates, including caching and SSL options.

### Data Flow and State Management
Data flows through the system in a structured manner, where requests are made to URLs, responses are processed, and results are stored or acted upon. State management is handled through session persistence, allowing users to maintain cookies and local storage across multiple runs.

## 3. Code Implementation

### Setup and Configuration
To get started with Crawl4AI, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies. You can install Crawl4AI using pip:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai
```

### Integration Steps
Integrate Crawl4AI into your project by importing the necessary classes and configuring your crawler as shown in the examples below.

### All Code Examples

#### 1. Proxy Usage
If you need to route your crawl traffic through a proxy—whether for IP rotation, geo-testing, or privacy—Crawl4AI supports it via `BrowserConfig.proxy_config`.

```python
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    browser_cfg = BrowserConfig(
        proxy_config={
            "server": "http://proxy.example.com:8080",
            "username": "myuser",
            "password": "mypass",
        },
        headless=True
    )
    crawler_cfg = CrawlerRunConfig(
        verbose=True
    )
    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_cfg) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://www.whatismyip.com/",
            config=crawler_cfg
        )
        if result.success:
            print("[OK] Page fetched via proxy.")
            print("Page HTML snippet:", result.html[:200])
        else:
            print("[ERROR]", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

#### 2. Capturing PDFs & Screenshots
Sometimes you need a visual record of a page or a PDF “printout.” Crawl4AI can do both in one pass:

```python
import os, asyncio
from base64 import b64decode
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CacheMode

async def main():
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions",
            cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS,
            pdf=True,
            screenshot=True
        )
        if result.success:
            # Save screenshot
            if result.screenshot:
                with open("wikipedia_screenshot.png", "wb") as f:
                    f.write(b64decode(result.screenshot))
            # Save PDF
            if result.pdf:
                with open("wikipedia_page.pdf", "wb") as f:
                    f.write(result.pdf)
            print("[OK] PDF & screenshot captured.")
        else:
            print("[ERROR]", result.error_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

#### 3. Handling SSL Certificates
If you need to verify or export a site’s SSL certificate—for compliance, debugging, or data analysis—Crawl4AI can fetch it during the crawl:

```python
import asyncio, os
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig, CacheMode

async def main():
    tmp_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "tmp")
    os.makedirs(tmp_dir, exist_ok=True)
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        fetch_ssl_certificate=True,
        cache_mode=CacheMode.BYPASS
    )
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(url="https://example.com", config=config)
        if result.success and result.ssl_certificate:
            cert = result.ssl_certificate
            print("\nCertificate Information:")
            print(f"Issuer (CN): {cert.issuer.get('CN', '')}")
            print(f"Valid until: {cert.valid_until}")
            print(f"Fingerprint: {cert.fingerprint}")
            # Export in multiple formats:
            cert.to_json(os.path.join(tmp_dir, "certificate.json"))
            cert.to_pem(os.path.join(tmp_dir, "certificate.pem"))
            cert.to_der(os.path.join(tmp_dir, "certificate.der"))
            print("\nCertificate exported to JSON/PEM/DER in 'tmp' folder.")
        else:
            print("[ERROR] No certificate or crawl failed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

#### 4. Custom Headers
Sometimes you need to set custom headers (e.g., language preferences, authentication tokens, or specialized user-agent strings). You can do this in multiple ways:

```python
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def main():
    # Option 1: Set headers at the crawler strategy level
    crawler1 = AsyncWebCrawler(
        # The underlying strategy can accept headers in its constructor
        crawler_strategy=None # We'll override below for clarity
    )
    crawler1.crawler_strategy.update_user_agent("MyCustomUA/1.0")
    crawler1.crawler_strategy.set_custom_headers({
        "Accept-Language": "fr-FR,fr;q=0.9"
    })
    result1 = await crawler1.arun("https://www.example.com")
    print("Example 1 result success:", result1.success)

    # Option 2: Pass headers directly to `arun()`
    crawler2 = AsyncWebCrawler()
    result2 = await crawler2.arun(
        url="https://www.example.com",
        headers={"Accept-Language": "es-ES,es;q=0.9"}
    )
    print("Example 2 result success:", result2.success)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

#### 5. Session Persistence & Local Storage
Crawl4AI can preserve cookies and localStorage so you can continue where you left off—ideal for logging into sites or skipping repeated auth flows.

##### 5.1 `storage_state`
```python
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler

async def main():
    storage_dict = {
        "cookies": [
            {
                "name": "session",
                "value": "abcd1234",
                "domain": "example.com",
                "path": "/",
                "expires": 1699999999.0,
                "httpOnly": False,
                "secure": False,
                "sameSite": "None"
            }
        ],
        "origins": [
            {
                "origin": "https://example.com",
                "localStorage": [
                    {"name": "token", "value": "my_auth_token"}
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    
    # Provide the storage state as a dictionary to start "already logged in"
    async with AsyncWebCrawler(
        headless=True,
        storage_state=storage_dict
    ) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun("https://example.com/protected")
        if result.success:
            print("Protected page content length:", len(result.html))
        else:
            print("Failed to crawl protected page")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

##### 5.2 Exporting & Reusing State
You can sign in once, export the browser context, and reuse it later—without re-entering credentials.
- **`await context.storage_state(path="my_storage.json")`**: Exports cookies, localStorage, etc. to a file.
- Provide `storage_state="my_storage.json"` on subsequent runs to skip the login step.

**See** : [Detailed session management tutorial](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/advanced/advanced-features/<../session-management/>) or [Explanations → Browser Context & Managed Browser](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/advanced/advanced-features/<../identity-based-crawling/>) for more advanced scenarios (like multi-step logins, or capturing after interactive pages).

#### 6. Robots.txt Compliance
Crawl4AI supports respecting robots.txt rules with efficient caching:

```python
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig

async def main():
    # Enable robots.txt checking in config
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        check_robots_txt=True # Will check and respect robots.txt rules
    )
    
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            "https://example.com",
            config=config
        )
        if not result.success and result.status_code == 403:
            print("Access denied by robots.txt")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Usage Patterns
Utilize the above code snippets as templates for your own projects. Adjust configurations based on your specific requirements such as proxy settings, session management, and data extraction needs.

## 4. Advanced Usage

### Optimization Techniques
To optimize crawling performance:
- Use headless mode to reduce resource consumption.
- Implement caching strategies to avoid redundant requests.

### Performance Considerations
Monitor the performance of your crawls by analyzing response times and success rates. Adjust concurrency settings based on the target website's capacity to handle requests.

### Security Considerations
Always ensure compliance with legal regulations regarding web scraping. Respect robots.txt rules and avoid overloading servers with excessive requests.

### Error Handling
Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage issues such as timeouts or unexpected responses. Use logging to track errors for future analysis.

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **403 Forbidden Errors**: Check if the target site has blocked your IP or if robots.txt rules are being violated.
- **Timeouts**: Increase timeout settings or check network connectivity.

### Debugging Strategies
Utilize logging to capture detailed information about each crawl attempt. This can help identify patterns in failures or performance bottlenecks.

### Known Limitations
Crawl4AI may struggle with heavily JavaScript-driven sites that require complex interactions beyond simple navigation.

### Best Practices
- Always test your crawlers on a small scale before scaling up.
- Regularly update your dependencies to benefit from performance improvements and security patches.
