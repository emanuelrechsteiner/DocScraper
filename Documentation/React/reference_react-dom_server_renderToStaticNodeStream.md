# renderToStaticNodeStream[](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream#undefined "Link for this heading")
`renderToStaticNodeStream` renders a non-interactive React tree to a [Node.js Readable Stream.](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#readable-streams)
```

const stream = renderToStaticNodeStream(reactNode, options?)

```

  * [Reference ](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream#reference)
    * [`renderToStaticNodeStream(reactNode, options?)` ](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream#rendertostaticnodestream)
  * [Usage ](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream#usage)
    * [Rendering a React tree as static HTML to a Node.js Readable Stream ](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream#rendering-a-react-tree-as-static-html-to-a-nodejs-readable-stream)


## Reference [](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream#reference "Link for Reference ")
### `renderToStaticNodeStream(reactNode, options?)` [](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream#rendertostaticnodestream "Link for this heading")
On the server, call `renderToStaticNodeStream` to get a [Node.js Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#readable-streams).
```

import { renderToStaticNodeStream } from 'react-dom/server';
const stream = renderToStaticNodeStream(<Page />);
stream.pipe(response);

```

[See more examples below.](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream#usage)
The stream will produce non-interactive HTML output of your React components.
#### Parameters [](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream#parameters "Link for Parameters ")
  * `reactNode`: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX element like `<Page />`.
  * **optional** `options`: An object for server render.
    * **optional** `identifierPrefix`: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by [`useId`.](https://18.react.dev/reference/react/useId) Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page.


#### Returns [](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream#returns "Link for Returns ")
A [Node.js Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#readable-streams) that outputs an HTML string. The resulting HTML can’t be hydrated on the client.
#### Caveats [](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream#caveats "Link for Caveats ")
  * `renderToStaticNodeStream` output cannot be hydrated.
  * This method will wait for all [Suspense boundaries](https://18.react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) to complete before returning any output.
  * As of React 18, this method buffers all of its output, so it doesn’t actually provide any streaming benefits.
  * The returned stream is a byte stream encoded in utf-8. If you need a stream in another encoding, take a look at a project like [iconv-lite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconv-lite), which provides transform streams for transcoding text.


## Usage [](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream#usage "Link for Usage ")
### Rendering a React tree as static HTML to a Node.js Readable Stream [](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticNodeStream#rendering-a-react-tree-as-static-html-to-a-nodejs-readable-stream "Link for Rendering a React tree as static HTML to a Node.js Readable Stream ")
Call `renderToStaticNodeStream` to get a [Node.js Readable Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#readable-streams) which you can pipe to your server response:
```

import { renderToStaticNodeStream } from 'react-dom/server';
// The route handler syntax depends on your backend framework
app.use('/', (request, response) => {
 const stream = renderToStaticNodeStream(<Page />);
 stream.pipe(response);
});

```

The stream will produce the initial non-interactive HTML output of your React components.
### Pitfall
This method renders **non-interactive HTML that cannot be hydrated.** This is useful if you want to use React as a simple static page generator, or if you’re rendering completely static content like emails.
Interactive apps should use [`renderToPipeableStream`](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToPipeableStream) on the server and [`hydrateRoot`](https://18.react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) on the client.
