[API Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react)
# Built-in React Hooks[](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks#undefined "Link for this heading")
 _Hooks_ let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in Hooks or combine them to build your own. This page lists all built-in Hooks in React.
## State Hooks [](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks#state-hooks "Link for State Hooks ")
_State_ lets a component [“remember” information like user input.](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory) For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index.
To add state to a component, use one of these Hooks:
  * [`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) declares a state variable that you can update directly.
  * [`useReducer`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer) declares a state variable with the update logic inside a [reducer function.](https://react.dev/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)


```

function ImageGallery() {
 const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
 // ...

```

## Context Hooks [](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks#context-hooks "Link for Context Hooks ")
_Context_ lets a component [receive information from distant parents without passing it as props.](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) For example, your app’s top-level component can pass the current UI theme to all components below, no matter how deep.
  * [`useContext`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) reads and subscribes to a context.


```

function Button() {
 const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
 // ...

```

## Ref Hooks [](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks#ref-hooks "Link for Ref Hooks ")
_Refs_ let a component [hold some information that isn’t used for rendering,](https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs) like a DOM node or a timeout ID. Unlike with state, updating a ref does not re-render your component. Refs are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. They are useful when you need to work with non-React systems, such as the built-in browser APIs.
  * [`useRef`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef) declares a ref. You can hold any value in it, but most often it’s used to hold a DOM node.
  * [`useImperativeHandle`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useImperativeHandle) lets you customize the ref exposed by your component. This is rarely used.


```

function Form() {
 const inputRef = useRef(null);
 // ...

```

## Effect Hooks [](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks#effect-hooks "Link for Effect Hooks ")
_Effects_ let a component [connect to and synchronize with external systems.](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code.
  * [`useEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) connects a component to an external system.


```

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
 useEffect(() => {
  const connection = createConnection(roomId);
  connection.connect();
  return () => connection.disconnect();
 }, [roomId]);
 // ...

```

Effects are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. Don’t use Effects to orchestrate the data flow of your application. If you’re not interacting with an external system, [you might not need an Effect.](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect)
There are two rarely used variations of `useEffect` with differences in timing:
  * [`useLayoutEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayoutEffect) fires before the browser repaints the screen. You can measure layout here.
  * [`useInsertionEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useInsertionEffect) fires before React makes changes to the DOM. Libraries can insert dynamic CSS here.


## Performance Hooks [](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks#performance-hooks "Link for Performance Hooks ")
A common way to optimize re-rendering performance is to skip unnecessary work. For example, you can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data has not changed since the previous render.
To skip calculations and unnecessary re-rendering, use one of these Hooks:
  * [`useMemo`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo) lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.
  * [`useCallback`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback) lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.


```

function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {
 const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);
 // ...
}

```

Sometimes, you can’t skip re-rendering because the screen actually needs to update. In that case, you can improve performance by separating blocking updates that must be synchronous (like typing into an input) from non-blocking updates which don’t need to block the user interface (like updating a chart).
To prioritize rendering, use one of these Hooks:
  * [`useTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition) lets you mark a state transition as non-blocking and allow other updates to interrupt it.
  * [`useDeferredValue`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue) lets you defer updating a non-critical part of the UI and let other parts update first.


## Other Hooks [](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks#other-hooks "Link for Other Hooks ")
These Hooks are mostly useful to library authors and aren’t commonly used in the application code.
  * [`useDebugValue`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDebugValue) lets you customize the label React DevTools displays for your custom Hook.
  * [`useId`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId) lets a component associate a unique ID with itself. Typically used with accessibility APIs.
  * [`useSyncExternalStore`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore) lets a component subscribe to an external store.


  * [`useActionState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState) allows you to manage state of actions.


## Your own Hooks [](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks#your-own-hooks "Link for Your own Hooks ")
You can also [define your own custom Hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#extracting-your-own-custom-hook-from-a-component) as JavaScript functions.
