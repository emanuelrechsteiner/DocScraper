# useTransition[](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#undefined "Link for this heading")
`useTransition` is a React Hook that lets you render a part of the UI in the background.
```

const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()

## Reference [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#reference "Link for Reference ")
### `useTransition()` [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#usetransition "Link for this heading")
Call `useTransition` at the top level of your component to mark some state updates as Transitions.
```

import { useTransition } from 'react';
function TabContainer() {
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 // ...
}

```

[See more examples below.](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#usage)
#### Parameters [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#parameters "Link for Parameters ")
`useTransition` does not take any parameters.
#### Returns [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#returns "Link for Returns ")
`useTransition` returns an array with exactly two items:
  1. The `isPending` flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition.
  2. The [`startTransition` function](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#starttransition) that lets you mark updates as a Transition.


### `startTransition(action)` [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#starttransition "Link for this heading")
The `startTransition` function returned by `useTransition` lets you mark an update as a Transition.
```

function TabContainer() {
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');
 function selectTab(nextTab) {
  startTransition(() => {
   setTab(nextTab);
  });
 }
 // ...
}

```

### Note
#### Functions called in `startTransition` are called “Actions”. [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#functions-called-in-starttransition-are-called-actions "Link for this heading")
The function passed to `startTransition` is called an “Action”. By convention, any callback called inside `startTransition` (such as a callback prop) should be named `action` or include the “Action” suffix:
```

function SubmitButton({ submitAction }) {
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 return (
  <button
   disabled={isPending}
   onClick={() => {
    startTransition(async () => {
     await submitAction();
    });
   }}
  >
   Submit
  </button>
 );
}

```

#### Parameters [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#starttransition-parameters "Link for Parameters ")
  * `action`: A function that updates some state by calling one or more [`set` functions](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#setstate). React calls `action` immediately with no parameters and marks all state updates scheduled synchronously during the `action` function call as Transitions. Any async calls that are awaited in the `action` will be included in the Transition, but currently require wrapping any `set` functions after the `await` in an additional `startTransition` (see [Troubleshooting](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-after-await-as-a-transition)). State updates marked as Transitions will be [non-blocking](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#marking-a-state-update-as-a-non-blocking-transition) and [will not display unwanted loading indicators](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#preventing-unwanted-loading-indicators).


#### Returns [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#starttransition-returns "Link for Returns ")
`startTransition` does not return anything.
#### Caveats [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#starttransition-caveats "Link for Caveats ")
  * `useTransition` is a Hook, so it can only be called inside components or custom Hooks. If you need to start a Transition somewhere else (for example, from a data library), call the standalone [`startTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition) instead.
  * You can wrap an update into a Transition only if you have access to the `set` function of that state. If you want to start a Transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook value, try [`useDeferredValue`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue) instead.
  * The function you pass to `startTransition` is called immediately, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as Transitions. If you try to perform state updates in a `setTimeout`, for example, they won’t be marked as Transitions.
  * You must wrap any state updates after any async requests in another `startTransition` to mark them as Transitions. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see [Troubleshooting](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-after-await-as-a-transition)).
  * The `startTransition` function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. [Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.](https://react.dev/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#move-dynamic-objects-and-functions-inside-your-effect)
  * A state update marked as a Transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a Transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input update.
  * Transition updates can’t be used to control text inputs.
  * If there are multiple ongoing Transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation that may be removed in a future release.


## Usage [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#usage "Link for Usage ")
### Perform non-blocking updates with Actions [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#perform-non-blocking-updates-with-actions "Link for Perform non-blocking updates with Actions ")
Call `useTransition` at the top of your component to create Actions, and access the pending state:
```

import {useState, useTransition} from 'react';
function CheckoutForm() {
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 // ...
}

```

`useTransition` returns an array with exactly two items:
  1. The `isPending` flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition.
  2. The `startTransition` function that lets you create an Action.


To start a Transition, pass a function to `startTransition` like this:
```

import {useState, useTransition} from 'react';
import {updateQuantity} from './api';
function CheckoutForm() {
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);
 function onSubmit(newQuantity) {
  startTransition(async function () {
   const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity);
   startTransition(() => {
    setQuantity(savedQuantity);
   });
  });
 }
 // ...
}

```

The function passed to `startTransition` is called the “Action”. You can update state and (optionally) perform side effects within an Action, and the work will be done in the background without blocking user interactions on the page. A Transition can include multiple Actions, and while a Transition is in progress, your UI stays responsive. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then changes their mind and clicks another tab, the second click will be immediately handled without waiting for the first update to finish.
To give the user feedback about in-progress Transitions, the `isPending` state switches to `true` at the first call to `startTransition`, and stays `true` until all Actions complete and the final state is shown to the user. Transitions ensure side effects in Actions to complete in order to [prevent unwanted loading indicators](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#preventing-unwanted-loading-indicators), and you can provide immediate feedback while the Transition is in progress with `useOptimistic`.
#### The difference between Actions and regular event handling[](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#examples "Link for The difference between Actions and regular event handling")
1. Updating the quantity in an Action 2. Updating the quantity without an Action 
#### 
Example 1 of 2: 
Updating the quantity in an Action [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#updating-the-quantity-in-an-action "Link for this heading")
In this example, the `updateQuantity` function simulates a request to the server to update the item’s quantity in the cart. This function is _artificially slowed down_ so that it takes at least a second to complete the request.
Update the quantity multiple times quickly. Notice that the pending “Total” state is shown while any requests are in progress, and the “Total” updates only after the final request is complete. Because the update is in an Action, the “quantity” can continue to be updated while the request is in progress.
App.jsItem.jsTotal.jsapi.js
App.js
ResetFork
```
import { useState, useTransition } from "react";
import { updateQuantity } from "./api";
import Item from "./Item";
import Total from "./Total";
export default function App({}) {
 const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 const updateQuantityAction = async newQuantity => {
  // To access the pending state of a transition,
  // call startTransition again.
  startTransition(async () => {
   const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity);
   startTransition(() => {
    setQuantity(savedQuantity);
   });
  });
 };
 return (
  <div>
   <h1>Checkout</h1>
   <Item action={updateQuantityAction}/>
   <hr />
   <Total quantity={quantity} isPending={isPending} />
  </div>
 );
}

```

This is a basic example to demonstrate how Actions work, but this example does not handle requests completing out of order. When updating the quantity multiple times, it’s possible for the previous requests to finish after later requests causing the quantity to update out of order. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see [Troubleshooting](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#my-state-updates-in-transitions-are-out-of-order) below).
For common use cases, React provides built-in abstractions such as:
  * [`useActionState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState)
  * [`<form>` actions](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/form)
  * [Server Functions](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions)


These solutions handle request ordering for you. When using Transitions to build your own custom hooks or libraries that manage async state transitions, you have greater control over the request ordering, but you must handle it yourself.
Next Example
### Exposing `action` prop from components [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#exposing-action-props-from-components "Link for this heading")
You can expose an `action` prop from a component to allow a parent to call an Action.
For example, this `TabButton` component wraps its `onClick` logic in an `action` prop:
```

export default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 if (isActive) {
  return <b>{children}</b>
 }
 return (
  <button onClick={() => {
   startTransition(async () => {
    // await the action that's passed in.
    // This allows it to be either sync or async. 
    await action();
   });
  }}>
   {children}
  </button>
 );
}

```

Because the parent component updates its state inside the `action`, that state update gets marked as a Transition. This means you can click on “Posts” and then immediately click “Contact” and it does not block user interactions:
App.jsTabButton.jsAboutTab.jsPostsTab.jsContactTab.js
TabButton.js
ResetFork
```
import { useTransition } from 'react';
export default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 if (isActive) {
  return <b>{children}</b>
 }
 if (isPending) {
  return <b className="pending">{children}</b>;
 }
 return (
  <button onClick={async () => {
   startTransition(async () => {
    // await the action that's passed in.
    // This allows it to be either sync or async. 
    await action();
   });
  }}>
   {children}
  </button>
 );
}

```

Show more
### Note
When exposing an `action` prop from a component, you should `await` it inside the transition.
This allows the `action` callback to be either synchronous or asynchronous without requiring an additional `startTransition` to wrap the `await` in the action.
### Displaying a pending visual state [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#displaying-a-pending-visual-state "Link for Displaying a pending visual state ")
You can use the `isPending` boolean value returned by `useTransition` to indicate to the user that a Transition is in progress. For example, the tab button can have a special “pending” visual state:
```

function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 // ...
 if (isPending) {
  return <b className="pending">{children}</b>;
 }
 // ...

```

Notice how clicking “Posts” now feels more responsive because the tab button itself updates right away:
App.jsTabButton.jsAboutTab.jsPostsTab.jsContactTab.js
TabButton.js
ResetFork
```
import { useTransition } from 'react';
export default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 if (isActive) {
  return <b>{children}</b>
 }
 if (isPending) {
  return <b className="pending">{children}</b>;
 }
 return (
  <button onClick={() => {
   startTransition(async () => {
    await action();
   });
  }}>
   {children}
  </button>
 );
}

```

### Preventing unwanted loading indicators [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#preventing-unwanted-loading-indicators "Link for Preventing unwanted loading indicators ")
In this example, the `PostsTab` component fetches some data using [use](https://react.dev/reference/react/use). When you click the “Posts” tab, the `PostsTab` component _suspends_ , causing the closest loading fallback to appear:
App.jsTabButton.js
App.js
ResetFork
```
import { Suspense, useState } from 'react';
import TabButton from './TabButton.js';
import AboutTab from './AboutTab.js';
import PostsTab from './PostsTab.js';
import ContactTab from './ContactTab.js';
export default function TabContainer() {
 const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');
 return (
  <Suspense fallback={<h1>🌀 Loading...</h1>}>
   <TabButton
    isActive={tab === 'about'}
    action={() => setTab('about')}
   >
    About
   </TabButton>
   <TabButton
    isActive={tab === 'posts'}
    action={() => setTab('posts')}
   >
    Posts
   </TabButton>
   <TabButton
    isActive={tab === 'contact'}
    action={() => setTab('contact')}
   >
    Contact
   </TabButton>
   <hr />
   {tab === 'about' && <AboutTab />}
   {tab === 'posts' && <PostsTab />}
   {tab === 'contact' && <ContactTab />}
  </Suspense>
 );
}

```

Show more
Hiding the entire tab container to show a loading indicator leads to a jarring user experience. If you add `useTransition` to `TabButton`, you can instead display the pending state in the tab button instead.
Notice that clicking “Posts” no longer replaces the entire tab container with a spinner:
App.jsTabButton.js
TabButton.js
ResetFork
```
import { useTransition } from 'react';
export default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 if (isActive) {
  return <b>{children}</b>
 }
 if (isPending) {
  return <b className="pending">{children}</b>;
 }
 return (
  <button onClick={() => {
   startTransition(async () => {
    await action();
   });
  }}>
   {children}
  </button>
 );
}

Transitions only “wait” long enough to avoid hiding _already revealed_ content (like the tab container). If the Posts tab had a [nested `<Suspense>` boundary,](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense#revealing-nested-content-as-it-loads) the Transition would not “wait” for it.
### Building a Suspense-enabled router [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#building-a-suspense-enabled-router "Link for Building a Suspense-enabled router ")
If you’re building a React framework or a router, we recommend marking page navigations as Transitions.
```

function Router() {
 const [page, setPage] = useState('/');
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 function navigate(url) {
  startTransition(() => {
   setPage(url);
  });
 }
 // ...

```

This is recommended for three reasons:
  * [Transitions are interruptible,](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#marking-a-state-update-as-a-non-blocking-transition) which lets the user click away without waiting for the re-render to complete.
  * [Transitions prevent unwanted loading indicators,](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#preventing-unwanted-loading-indicators) which lets the user avoid jarring jumps on navigation.
  * [Transitions wait for all pending actions](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#perform-non-blocking-updates-with-actions) which lets the user wait for side effects to complete before the new page is shown.


Here is a simplified router example using Transitions for navigations.

App.js

```
import { Suspense, useState, useTransition } from 'react';
import IndexPage from './IndexPage.js';
import ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js';
import Layout from './Layout.js';
export default function App() {
 return (
  <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>
   <Router />
  </Suspense>
 );
}
function Router() {
 const [page, setPage] = useState('/');
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 function navigate(url) {
  startTransition(() => {
   setPage(url);
  });
 }
 let content;
 if (page === '/') {
  content = (
   <IndexPage navigate={navigate} />
  );
 } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {
  content = (
   <ArtistPage
    artist={{
     id: 'the-beatles',
     name: 'The Beatles',
    }}
   />
  );
 }
 return (
  <Layout isPending={isPending}>
   {content}
  </Layout>
 );
}
function BigSpinner() {
 return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;
}

### Note
[Suspense-enabled](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into Transitions by default.
### Displaying an error to users with an error boundary [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#displaying-an-error-to-users-with-error-boundary "Link for Displaying an error to users with an error boundary ")
If a function passed to `startTransition` throws an error, you can display an error to your user with an [error boundary](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary). To use an error boundary, wrap the component where you are calling the `useTransition` in an error boundary. Once the function passed to `startTransition` errors, the fallback for the error boundary will be displayed.
AddCommentContainer.js
AddCommentContainer.js
ResetFork
```
import { useTransition } from "react";
import { ErrorBoundary } from "react-error-boundary";
export function AddCommentContainer() {
 return (
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>⚠️Something went wrong</p>}>
   <AddCommentButton />
  </ErrorBoundary>
 );
}
function addComment(comment) {
 // For demonstration purposes to show Error Boundary
 if (comment == null) {
  throw new Error("Example Error: An error thrown to trigger error boundary");
 }
}
function AddCommentButton() {
 const [pending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 return (
  <button
   disabled={pending}
   onClick={() => {
    startTransition(() => {
     // Intentionally not passing a comment
     // so error gets thrown
     addComment();
    });
   }}
  >
   Add comment
  </button>
 );
}

## Troubleshooting [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#troubleshooting "Link for Troubleshooting ")
### Updating an input in a Transition doesn’t work [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#updating-an-input-in-a-transition-doesnt-work "Link for Updating an input in a Transition doesn’t work ")
You can’t use a Transition for a state variable that controls an input:
```

const [text, setText] = useState('');
// ...
function handleChange(e) {
 // ❌ Can't use Transitions for controlled input state
 startTransition(() => {
  setText(e.target.value);
 });
}
// ...
return <input value={text} onChange={handleChange} />;

```

This is because Transitions are non-blocking, but updating an input in response to the change event should happen synchronously. If you want to run a Transition in response to typing, you have two options:
  1. You can declare two separate state variables: one for the input state (which always updates synchronously), and one that you will update in a Transition. This lets you control the input using the synchronous state, and pass the Transition state variable (which will “lag behind” the input) to the rest of your rendering logic.
  2. Alternatively, you can have one state variable, and add [`useDeferredValue`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue) which will “lag behind” the real value. It will trigger non-blocking re-renders to “catch up” with the new value automatically.


### React doesn’t treat my state update as a Transition [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-as-a-transition "Link for React doesn’t treat my state update as a Transition ")
When you wrap a state update in a Transition, make sure that it happens _during_ the `startTransition` call:
```

startTransition(() => {
 // ✅ Setting state *during* startTransition call
 setPage('/about');
});

```

The function you pass to `startTransition` must be synchronous. You can’t mark an update as a Transition like this:
```

startTransition(() => {
 // ❌ Setting state *after* startTransition call
 setTimeout(() => {
  setPage('/about');
 }, 1000);
});

```

Instead, you could do this:
```

setTimeout(() => {
 startTransition(() => {
  // ✅ Setting state *during* startTransition call
  setPage('/about');
 });
}, 1000);

```

### React doesn’t treat my state update after `await` as a Transition [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-after-await-as-a-transition "Link for this heading")
When you use `await` inside a `startTransition` function, the state updates that happen after the `await` are not marked as Transitions. You must wrap state updates after each `await` in a `startTransition` call:
```

startTransition(async () => {
 await someAsyncFunction();
 // ❌ Not using startTransition after await
 setPage('/about');
});

```

However, this works instead:
```

startTransition(async () => {
 await someAsyncFunction();
 // ✅ Using startTransition *after* await
 startTransition(() => {
  setPage('/about');
 });
});

```

This is a JavaScript limitation due to React losing the scope of the async context. In the future, when [AsyncContext](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context) is available, this limitation will be removed.
### I want to call `useTransition` from outside a component [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#i-want-to-call-usetransition-from-outside-a-component "Link for this heading")
You can’t call `useTransition` outside a component because it’s a Hook. In this case, use the standalone [`startTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition) method instead. It works the same way, but it doesn’t provide the `isPending` indicator.
### The function I pass to `startTransition` executes immediately [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#the-function-i-pass-to-starttransition-executes-immediately "Link for this heading")
If you run this code, it will print 1, 2, 3:
```

console.log(1);
startTransition(() => {
 console.log(2);
 setPage('/about');
});
console.log(3);

```

**It is expected to print 1, 2, 3.** The function you pass to `startTransition` does not get delayed. Unlike with the browser `setTimeout`, it does not run the callback later. React executes your function immediately, but any state updates scheduled _while it is running_ are marked as Transitions. You can imagine that it works like this:
```

// A simplified version of how React works
let isInsideTransition = false;
function startTransition(scope) {
 isInsideTransition = true;
 scope();
 isInsideTransition = false;
}
function setState() {
 if (isInsideTransition) {
  // ... schedule a Transition state update ...
 } else {
  // ... schedule an urgent state update ...
 }
}

```

### My state updates in Transitions are out of order [](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#my-state-updates-in-transitions-are-out-of-order "Link for My state updates in Transitions are out of order ")
If you `await` inside `startTransition`, you might see the updates happen out of order.
In this example, the `updateQuantity` function simulates a request to the server to update the item’s quantity in the cart. This function _artificially returns the every other request after the previous_ to simulate race conditions for network requests.
Try updating the quantity once, then update it quickly multiple times. You might see the incorrect total:
App.jsItem.jsTotal.jsapi.js
App.js
ResetFork
```
import { useState, useTransition } from "react";
import { updateQuantity } from "./api";
import Item from "./Item";
import Total from "./Total";
export default function App({}) {
 const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);
 const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
 // Store the actual quantity in separate state to show the mismatch.
 const [clientQuantity, setClientQuantity] = useState(1);
 
 const updateQuantityAction = newQuantity => {
  setClientQuantity(newQuantity);
  // Access the pending state of the transition,
  // by wrapping in startTransition again.
  startTransition(async () => {
   const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity);
   startTransition(() => {
    setQuantity(savedQuantity);
   });
  });
 };
 return (
  <div>
   <h1>Checkout</h1>
   <Item action={updateQuantityAction}/>
   <hr />
   <Total clientQuantity={clientQuantity} savedQuantity={quantity} isPending={isPending} />
  </div>
 );
}

```

When clicking multiple times, it’s possible for previous requests to finish after later requests. When this happens, React currently has no way to know the intended order. This is because the updates are scheduled asynchronously, and React loses context of the order across the async boundary.
This is expected, because Actions within a Transition do not guarantee execution order. For common use cases, React provides higher-level abstractions like [`useActionState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState) and [`<form>` actions](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/form) that handle ordering for you. For advanced use cases, you’ll need to implement your own queuing and abort logic to handle this.
Example of `useActionState` handling execution order:
App.jsItem.jsTotal.jsapi.js
App.js
ResetFork
```
import { useState, useActionState } from "react";
import { updateQuantity } from "./api";
import Item from "./Item";
import Total from "./Total";
export default function App({}) {
 // Store the actual quantity in separate state to show the mismatch.
 const [clientQuantity, setClientQuantity] = useState(1);
 const [quantity, updateQuantityAction, isPending] = useActionState(
  async (prevState, payload) => {
   setClientQuantity(payload);
   const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(payload);
   return savedQuantity; // Return the new quantity to update the state
  },
  1 // Initial quantity
 );
 return (
  <div>
   <h1>Checkout</h1>
   <Item action={updateQuantityAction}/>
   <hr />
   <Total clientQuantity={clientQuantity} savedQuantity={quantity} isPending={isPending} />
  </div>
 );
}

```
