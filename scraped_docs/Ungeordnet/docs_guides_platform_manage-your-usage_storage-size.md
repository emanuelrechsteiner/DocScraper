Manage Storage size usage
## What you are charged for[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size#what-you-are-charged-for)
You are charged for the total size of all assets in your buckets.
## How charges are calculated[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size#how-charges-are-calculated)
Storage size is charged by Gigabyte-Hours (GB-Hrs). 1 GB-Hr represents the use of 1 GB of storage for 1 hour. For example, storing 10 GB of data for 5 hours results in 50 GB-Hrs (10 GB Ã— 5 hours).
### Usage on your invoice[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size#usage-on-your-invoice)
Usage is shown as "Storage Size GB-Hrs" on your invoice.
## Pricing[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size#pricing)
$0.00002919 per GB-Hr ($0.021 per GB per month). You are only charged for usage exceeding your subscription plan's quota.

### Within quota[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size#within-quota)
The organization's Storage size usage is within the quota, so no charges for Storage size apply.

### Exceeding quota[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size#exceeding-quota)

## View usage[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size#view-usage)
### Usage page[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size#usage-page)
You can view Storage size usage on the [organization's usage page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/usage). The page shows the usage of all projects by default. To view the usage for a specific project, select it from the dropdown. You can also select a different time period.
![Usage page navigation bar](https://supabase.com/docs/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fimg%2Fguides%2Fplatform%2Fusage-navbar--light.png&w=3840&q=75)
In the Storage size section, you can see how much storage your projects have used during the selected time period.

### SQL Editor[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size#sql-editor)
Since we designed Storage to work as an integrated part of your Postgres database on Supabase, you can query information about your Storage objects in the `storage` schema.
