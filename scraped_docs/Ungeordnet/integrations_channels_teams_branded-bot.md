# How to build and install a branded Microsoft Teams bot
Runbear is a no/low-code solution for connecting communication channels with LLM (Large Language Model) applications. For example, it enables the creation of a bot for MS Teams from an LLM app in just a few clicks.
## How does it works?[​](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations/channels/teams/branded-bot/#how-does-it-works "Direct link to How does it works?")
The branded bot works just like [default MS Teams integration](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations/channels/teams), but you can customize the bot name, icon, and description and install it wherever you want.
## Integration Walkthrough[​](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations/channels/teams/branded-bot/#integration-walkthrough "Direct link to Integration Walkthrough")
### Build Branded Bot[​](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations/channels/teams/branded-bot/#build-branded-bot "Direct link to Build Branded Bot")
  1. Navigate to channels. Click the `Branded Bots` button of the Microsoft Teams tile. ![Branded Bots button on Microsoft Teams card](https://docs.runbear.io/assets/images/entrypoint-dbecf7cef82c186015f5a26538bb680f.png)
  2. On the bot management page, click the `Build Bot` button at the top.
  3. On the bot creation page, enter the fields shown in the image below. In the `Pre-Connected LLM Apps` section at the bottom, select an LLM app so it can be invoked after the bot is installed in MS Teams. You can also see the entered bot customizations in real-time in the preview on the right.

  4. Click the `Create` button, which takes a few seconds, and a dialog like the one below will appear. Click the `Download` button to download the installation file for the bot you created.

### Install the bot[​](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations/channels/teams/branded-bot/#install-the-bot "Direct link to Install the bot")
After creating the bot, download the installation file (zip) and unzip it once. Inside, you'll find the actual bot installation file along with a detailed installation guide. Follow the guide to install the bot.
### Delete the bot[​](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations/channels/teams/branded-bot/#delete-the-bot "Direct link to Delete the bot")
If you want to delete the bot, you can do so by clicking the `Delete` button on the bot management page. Once deleted, it cannot be restored, and it will be deleted from all MS Teams organizations where the bot is installed, and all Runbear connections connected to the bot will also be deleted.
