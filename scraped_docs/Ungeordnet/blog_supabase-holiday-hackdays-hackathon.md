While not everyone will be celebrating the holidays this December, we can all be united in celebrating open-source software, and to do so we're kicking off the "Holiday Hackdays" (loosely inspired by the [12 Pubs of Christmas](https://www.irelandbeforeyoudie.com/12-pubs-of-christmas-rules-tips-everything-you-need-for-a-great-night/), only a bit healthier).
Starting today at 7am PT we'll be hacking together for the next 10 days until 23:59pm PT on Sunday December 12th. And because we've launched [row-level security for our Realtime API](https://supabase.com/blog/realtime-row-level-security-in-postgresql) earlier this week, we'd love for you to use it in your Hackathon project. May it be to build a [Santa Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-your-own-santa-tracker-with-gatsby-and-react-leaflet/) or that secure family chat app to bring all your relatives together for the festive season, be creative and most importantly have fun ðŸ¥³
[As always](https://supabase.com/blog/hacktoberfest-hackathon-winners-2021#the-prizes), we'll have some extremely limited edition swag to give away that can only be won by participating in the Hackathon!
The Supabase team will be participating as well, for example [Jon](https://twitter.com/_dijonmusters) and I, inspired by [Egghead's "Holiday Course Release Extravaganza"](https://egghead.io/20-days), will be building an Advent Calendar for all the [awesome community content](https://supabase.com/blog/community-day#new-tutorials-and-integration-guides) you've been creating. Get ready for a cool open-source project which will be using a lot of the hottest Supabase features! To make sure you don't miss this one, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/supabase) and subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/supabase). We'll see you there.
