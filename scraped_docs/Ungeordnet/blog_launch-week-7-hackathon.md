With Easter just around the corner, [Launch Week](https://supabase.com/launch-week) is about to start and, as usual, we're running an async hackathon alongside it. This time itâ€™s AI-themed!
The hackathon starts **now** and ends Sunday 16th April at 11:59 pm. You can win extremely limited edition Launch Week themed mechanical keyboards and limited edition Supabase swag.
For some inspiration check out the [Next.js OpenAI Doc Search template](https://github.com/supabase-community/nextjs-openai-doc-search?og=v2) released yesterday and [storing embeddings on Supabase article](https://supabase.com/blog/openai-embeddings-postgres-vector).
Additionally, you can see all the [winners from previous hackathons](https://supabase.com/blog/tags/hackathon).
