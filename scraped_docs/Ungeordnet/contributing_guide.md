Learn how to run Firecrawl locally to run on your own and/or contribute to the project.
Welcome to [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) ðŸ”¥! Here are some instructions on how to get the project locally so you can run it on your own and contribute.
If youâ€™re contributing, note that the process is similar to other open-source repos, i.e., fork Firecrawl, make changes, run tests, PR.
If you have any questions or would like help getting on board, join our Discord community [here](https://discord.gg/gSmWdAkdwd) for more information or submit an issue on Github [here](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/issues/new/choose)!
## 
[â€‹](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/contributing/guide#running-the-project-locally)
Running the project locally
First, start by installing dependencies:
  1. node.js [instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)
  2. pnpm [instructions](https://pnpm.io/installation)
  3. redis [instructions](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/)


Set environment variables in a `.env` file in the `/apps/api/` directory. You can copy over the template in `.env.example`.
To start, we wonâ€™t set up authentication, or any optional sub services (pdf parsing, JS blocking support, AI features)
Copy
```
# ./apps/api/.env
# ===== Required ENVS ======
NUM_WORKERS_PER_QUEUE=8 
PORT=3002
HOST=0.0.0.0
#for self-hosting using docker, use redis://redis:6379. For running locally, use redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
#for self-hosting using docker, use redis://redis:6379. For running locally, use redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_RATE_LIMIT_URL=redis://localhost:6379 
PLAYWRIGHT_MICROSERVICE_URL=http://playwright-service:3000/html
## To turn on DB authentication, you need to set up supabase.
USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION=false
# ===== Optional ENVS ======
# Supabase Setup (used to support DB authentication, advanced logging, etc.)
SUPABASE_ANON_TOKEN= 
SUPABASE_URL=

# set if you'd like to block media requests to save proxy bandwidth
BLOCK_MEDIA=
# Set this to the URL of your webhook when using the self-hosted version of FireCrawl

# LOGGING_LEVEL determines the verbosity of logs that the system will output.
# Available levels are:
# NONE - No logs will be output.
# ERROR - For logging error messages that indicate a failure in a specific operation.
# WARN - For logging potentially harmful situations that are not necessarily errors.
# INFO - For logging informational messages that highlight the progress of the application.
# DEBUG - For logging detailed information on the flow through the system, primarily used for debugging.
# TRACE - For logging more detailed information than the DEBUG level.
# Set LOGGING_LEVEL to one of the above options to control logging output.
LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO

Installing dependencies
First, install the dependencies using pnpm.
Copy
```
# cd apps/api # to make sure you're in the right folder
pnpm install # make sure you have pnpm version 9+!

```

###

Running the project
Youâ€™re going to need to open 3 terminals for running the services. Here is [a video guide accurate as of Oct 2024](https://youtu.be/LHqg5QNI4UY) (optional: 4 terminals for running the services and testing).
### 
[â€‹](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/contributing/guide#terminal-1-setting-up-redis)
Terminal 1 - setting up redis
Run the command anywhere within your project
Copy
```
redis-server

```

### 
[â€‹](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/contributing/guide#terminal-2-setting-up-workers)
Terminal 2 - setting up workers
Now, navigate to the apps/api/ directory and run:
Copy
```
pnpm run workers
# if you are going to use the [llm-extract feature](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/pull/586/), you should also export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-______

```

This will start the workers who are responsible for processing crawl jobs.
### 
[â€‹](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/contributing/guide#terminal-3-setting-up-the-main-server)
Terminal 3 - setting up the main server
To do this, navigate to the apps/api/ directory. If you havenâ€™t installed pnpm already, you can do so here: <https://pnpm.io/installation>
Next, run your server with:
Copy
```
pnpm run start

```

### 
[â€‹](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/contributing/guide#optional-terminal-4-sending-our-first-request)
 _(Optional)_ Terminal 4 - sending our first request
Alright, now letâ€™s send our first request.
Copy
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:3002/test

```

This should return the response Hello, world!
If youâ€™d like to test the crawl endpoint, you can run this
Copy
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/v0/crawl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
   "url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev"
  }'

```

## 
[â€‹](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/contributing/guide#tests%3A)
Tests:
The best way to do this is run the test with `npm run test:local-no-auth` if youâ€™d like to run the tests without authentication.
If youâ€™d like to run the tests with authentication, run `npm run test:prod`
