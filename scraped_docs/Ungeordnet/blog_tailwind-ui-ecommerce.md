Almost 6 months in the making, we finally released the first all-new component kit for [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) since the initial launch back in February 2020!
[Tailwind UI Ecommerce](https://tailwindui.com/#product-ecommerce) adds over 100 new components across 14 new component categories and 7 new page example categories, including stuff like:
  * Product Overviews
  * Product Lists
  * Category Previews
  * Shopping Carts
  * Category Filters
  * Product Quickviews
  * Store Navigation
  * Promo Sections
  * Checkout Forms
  * Customer Reviews
  * Order Summaries
  * Storefront Pages
  * Product Pages
  * Order History Pages


...and more.
For a quick preview, check out this product page example we shared via our newsletter last week:

It's been a really fun and challenging process putting this together, and I'm really proud of how it turned out. I wrote up a big post about ["Designing Tailwind UI Ecommerce"](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/designing-tailwind-ui-ecommerce) that's worth a read if you're interested in the process behind putting together a new Tailwind UI product like this.
You can check out a bunch more interactive previews as well as screenshots of every single new example over at [the Tailwind UI website](https://tailwindui.com/#product-ecommerce).
If you like what you see, consider [purchasing a license](https://tailwindui.com/pricing) — it's the best way to support our work on Tailwind CSS and Headless UI and makes it possible for us to keep making these tools better and better.
