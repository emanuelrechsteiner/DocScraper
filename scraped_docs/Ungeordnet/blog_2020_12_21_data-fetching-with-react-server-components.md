# Introducing Zero-Bundle-Size React Server Components[](https://react.dev/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components#undefined "Link for this heading")
December 21, 2020 by [Dan Abramov](https://bsky.app/profile/danabra.mov), [Lauren Tan](https://twitter.com/potetotes), [Joseph Savona](https://twitter.com/en_JS), and [Sebastian Markbåge](https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage)
2020 has been a long year. As it comes to an end we wanted to share a special Holiday Update on our research into zero-bundle-size **React Server Components**.
To introduce React Server Components, we have prepared a talk and a demo. If you want, you can check them out during the holidays, or later when work picks back up in the new year.
**React Server Components are still in research and development.** We are sharing this work in the spirit of transparency and to get initial feedback from the React community. There will be plenty of time for that, so **don’t feel like you have to catch up right now!**
If you want to check them out, we recommend going in the following order:
  1. **Watch the talk** to learn about React Server Components and see the demo.
  2. **[Clone the demo](http://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo)** to play with React Server Components on your computer.
  3. **[Read the RFC (with FAQ at the end)](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/188)** for a deeper technical breakdown and to provide feedback.


We are excited to hear from you on the RFC or in replies to the [@reactjs](https://twitter.com/reactjs) Twitter handle. Happy holidays, stay safe, and see you next year!
