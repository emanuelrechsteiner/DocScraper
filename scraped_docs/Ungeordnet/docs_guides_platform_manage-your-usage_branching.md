Manage Branching usage
## What you are charged for[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/branching#what-you-are-charged-for)
Each [Preview branch](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/deployment/branching) is a separate environment with all Supabase services (Database, Auth, Storage, etc.). You're charged for usage within that environment—such as [Compute](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/compute), [Disk Size](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/disk-size), [Egress](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/egress), and [Storage](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size)—just like the project you branched from.
Usage by Preview branches counts toward your subscription plan's quota.
## How charges are calculated[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/branching#how-charges-are-calculated)
Refer to individual [usage items](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage) for details on how charges are calculated. Branching charges are the sum of all these items.
### Usage on your invoice[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/branching#usage-on-your-invoice)
Compute incurred by Preview branches is shown as "Branching Compute Hours" on your invoice. Other usage items are not shown separately for branches and are rolled up into the project.
## Pricing[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/branching#pricing)
There is no fixed fee for a Preview branch. You only pay for the usage it incurs. With Compute costs of $0.01344 per hour, a branch running on Micro Compute size starts at $0.32 per day.
## Billing examples[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/branching#billing-examples)
The project has a Preview branch "XYZ", that runs for 30 hours, incurring Compute and Egress costs. Disk Size usage remains within the 8 GB included in the subscription plan, so no additional charges apply.
Line Item| Costs  
---|---  
Pro Plan| $25  
|   
Compute Hours Small Project 1| $15  
Egress Project 1| $7  
Disk Size Project 1| $3  
|   
Compute Hours Micro Branch XYZ| $0.4  
Egress Branch XYZ| $1  
Disk Size Branch XYZ| $0  
|   
**Subtotal**| **$51.4**  
Compute Credits| -$10  
**Total**| **$41.4**  
## View usage[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/branching#view-usage)
You can view Branching usage on the [organization's usage page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/usage). The page shows the usage of all projects by default. To view the usage for a specific project, select it from the dropdown. You can also select a different time period.
![Usage page navigation bar](https://supabase.com/docs/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fimg%2Fguides%2Fplatform%2Fusage-navbar--light.png&w=3840&q=75)
In the Usage Summary section, you can see how many hours your Preview branches existed during the selected time period. Hover over "Branching Compute Hours" for a detailed breakdown.
![Usage summary Branching Compute Hours](https://supabase.com/docs/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fimg%2Fguides%2Fplatform%2Fusage-summary-branch-hours--light.png&w=3840&q=75)
## Optimize usage[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/branching#optimize-usage)
  * Merge Preview branches as soon as they are ready
  * Delete Preview branches that are no longer in use
  * Check whether your [persistent branches](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/deployment/branching#persistent-branches) need to be defined as persistent, or if they can be ephemeral instead. Persistent branches will remain active even after the underlying PR is closed.


## FAQ[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/branching#faq)
