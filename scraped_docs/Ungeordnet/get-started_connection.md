# Connecting Channels with LLM Apps
**Connection** is how you link a channel to an LLM app. Essentially, it's a relationship between one Channel and one LLM app. It also supports various settings, such as choosing a Slack channel to attach and setting conditions to trigger the LLM app.
You can create connections under the assistant detail page. To access this, first navigate to the [Assistants](https://runbear.io/assistants) page.

After creating a connection, you can send queries to your LLM apps through your communication channels. For example, if you used Slack as a Channel, open the Slack channel where you integrated your LLM app and mention @Runbear followed by a question. Your LLM app will respond to it.
