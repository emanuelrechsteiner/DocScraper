# MS Teams Integration Guide
Runbear is a no/low-code solution for connecting communication channels with LLM (Large Language Model) applications. For example, it enables the creation of a Teams bot from an LLM app in just a few clicks.
## How to integrate[​](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations/channels/teams#how-to-integrate "Direct link to How to integrate")
  1. First, click the `Connect` button on the MS Teams card on the [Integrations page](https://runbear.io/integrations), or simply click **[here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/99783ae9-6345-4245-aa1d-fd7d78749f11)** to install the Runbear app.
  2. Next, in MS Teams, click `Add to a Team` and choose the team or group chat where you wish to add the bot.
  3. Once added, the Runbear bot will display a card with a `Complete Setup` button. Clicking this button will redirect you to the Runbear website.
  4. Enter your Teams name and click `Add`.
  5. That's it! Now connect your LLM app to the Teams. If you haven't created an LLM app yet, visit [our use cases](https://docs.runbear.io/use-cases).


## Troubleshooting[​](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations/channels/teams#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")
**Unable to Find My Team/Group Chat When Connecting**
![Teams not found](https://docs.runbear.io/assets/images/integration-channel-teams-add-app-886b0dbed89949933cc1d24e847e8d05.png)
If your team or group chat doesn't appear while setting up a connection on the Runbear website, it may be because the **Runbear app isn't installed in that team or group chat**. To resolve this, click `+ Add conversation` in the dropdown menu and install the app in your desired team or group chat. Refresh the connection page afterward, and the newly installed channel or group chat should be visible. If you encounter any issues after these steps, please don't hesitate to contact us.
**App Installed, but No`Complete Setup` Message Received from the Bot**
In MS Teams, it's possible to install the same bot into a team or group chat more than once. If you've previously installed the bot, you might not receive another `Complete Setup` message. In such cases, there's no need to reinstall the bot. Simply proceed to connect your LLM app with Teams.
