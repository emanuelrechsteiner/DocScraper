When you build UI components that are used by **tens of thousands of developers** , you learn to really care about the details, like:
  * **Building layouts that don't break** when the content is longer than you planned for in Figma
  * Making a table scrollable, **without the content getting cropped** by the page padding
  * **Automatically aligning icons** in dropdown menus, even when some items are just text
  * Making an entire card clickable, **without destroying the experience** for screen readers
  * **Fine-tuning click targets for mobile** , without making everything else harder to maintain
  * Getting the border radius **mathematically perfect** on nested elements, without hard-coding magic numbers


**“Build UIs that don’t suck”** is a crash course in some of the coolest tricks I've picked up over the years building things that need to be both beautiful and bullet-proof.
**Every day for a week I'll send you a short video lesson** walking you through an interesting UI problem, **as well as the code** so you can play with it yourself and adapt it for your own projects.
