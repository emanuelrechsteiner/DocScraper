![Supabase Launch Week II: The SQL](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Flaunch-week-sql%2Fsupabase-launch-the-sql.png&w=3840&q=100&dpl=dpl_9xPTPeSUKoDuygMmT5sPj6DB4mgG)
In March, Supabase held a [Launch Week](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week) where we launched a new product/feature every day for a week.
It may seem crazy to do another launch week just four months later, but we couldn't give up on a good pun, so get ready for **Launch Week II: the SQL**.
## What to expect[#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-sql#what-to-expect)
Just like last time, we don't want to spoil the surprise. So for now we'll give you a teaser of what to expect. Come back each day to see what we launch, or follow us on Twitter to keep up to date: [@supabase](https://twitter.com/supabase) and follow the hashtag [#supalaunchweek](https://twitter.com/hashtag/supalaunchweek).
## Monday 26 July: Community Day[#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-sql#monday-26-july-community-day)
![Supabase Community](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Flaunch-week-sql%2Fcommunity-day.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_9xPTPeSUKoDuygMmT5sPj6DB4mgG)
### **When?**[ #](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-sql#when)
Monday 26 July 2021.
### What?[#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-sql#what)
One of the best things about building Supabase is the community. We're even luckier because we're an amalgamation of tools like Postgres and PostgREST. We're starting the week by shining a spotlight on some of the latest developments from the community.

### What?[#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-sql#what-2)
What's cooler than Arnie in the 90's? Passwordless logins. We've [already](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-apple) [built](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-bitbucket) [support](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-discord) [for](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-facebook) [eight](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github) [different](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-gitlab) [Oauth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google) [providers](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-twitter), so it's anyone's guess what can happen in Supabase Auth Episode II.
