Billing and account management support is available to all customers.
Limited technical support is accessible for Supabase customers utilizing paid Supabase resources and/or paid Supabase Add-Ons. Support requests will only be processed if:

## Community Support[#](https://supabase.com/support-policy#community-support)
Supabase support staff will only address support requests received through the official channels mentioned earlier. However, community channels may exist for peer-to-peer support and discussions. This is support provided by volunteers that contribute to the Supabase community.
For questions related to debugging code, we recommend reaching out on **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions)** or on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/rxTfewPvys)**. The community is made up of experienced developers who may be able to provide guidance and support with code-related issues.
To get the most helpful response from the community, providing precise and detailed information about your problem and any error messages you may be encountering is important. Be sure to **include any relevant code snippets explaining how to reproduce** the issue in your message.
Please note that Supabase team members may participate in community channels at their discretion, but there is no guarantee of response for support issues unless they are submitted through one of the official channels above.

In the event of a platform issue, a notice will be posted on our platform status site at [status.supabase.com](https://status.supabase.com/) to promptly communicate the impact and status of any such issue. You do not need to submit a support ticket if there's an ongoing platform issue. Instead, monitor the status page which will always be kept up-to-date with the latest progress and information.
