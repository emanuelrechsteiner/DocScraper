Managing Indexes in PostgreSQL
An index makes your Postgres queries faster. The index is like a "table of contents" for your data - a reference list which allows queries to quickly locate a row in a given table without needing to scan the entire table (which in large tables can take a long time).
Indexes can be structured in a few different ways. The type of index chosen depends on the values you are indexing. By far the most common index type, and the default in Postgres, is the B-Tree. A B-Tree is the generalized form of a binary search tree, where nodes can have more than two children.
Even though indexes improve query performance, the Postgres query planner may not always make use of a given index when choosing which optimizations to make. Additionally indexes come with some overhead - additional writes and increased storage - so it's useful to understand how and when to use indexes, if at all.
## Create an index[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/indexes#create-an-index)
Let's take an example table:
```

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
createtablepersons ( id bigintgeneratedbydefaultasidentityprimary key, age int, height int,weightint,nametext, deceased boolean);

```

All the queries in this guide can be run using the [SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql) in the Supabase Dashboard, or via `psql` if you're [connecting directly to the database](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#direct-connections).
We might want to frequently query users based on their age:
```

1
selectnamefrom persons where age =32;

```

Without an index, Postgres will scan every row in the table to find equality matches on age.
You can verify this by doing an explain on the query:
```

1
explain selectnamefrom persons where age =32;

```

Outputs:
```

1
2
Seq Scan on persons (cost=0.00..22.75 rows=x width=y)Filter: (age = 32)

```

To add a simple B-Tree index you can run:
```

1
createindexidx_persons_ageon persons (age);

```

It can take a long time to build indexes on large datasets and the default behaviour of `create index` is to lock the table from writes.
Luckily Postgres provides us with `create index concurrently` which prevents blocking writes on the table, but does take a bit longer to build.
Here is a simplified diagram of the index we just created (note that in practice, nodes actually have more than two children).
![B-Tree index example in Postgres](https://supabase.com/docs/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fimg%2Fdatabase%2Fmanaging-indexes%2Fcreating-indexes--light.png&w=3840&q=75)
You can see that in any large data set, traversing the index to locate a given value can be done in much less operations (O(log n)) than compared to scanning the table one value at a time from top to bottom (O(n)).
## Partial indexes[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/indexes#partial-indexes)
If you are frequently querying a subset of rows then it may be more efficient to build a partial index. In our example, perhaps we only want to match on `age` where `deceased is false`. We could build a partial index:
```

1
2
createindexidx_living_persons_ageon persons (age)where deceased is false;

```

## Ordering indexes[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/indexes#ordering-indexes)
By default B-Tree indexes are sorted in ascending order, but sometimes you may want to provide a different ordering. Perhaps our application has a page featuring the top 10 oldest people. Here we would want to sort in descending order, and include `NULL` values last. For this we can use:
```

1
createindexidx_persons_age_descon persons (age descnullslast);

```

## Reindexing[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/indexes#reindexing)
After a while indexes can become stale and may need rebuilding. Postgres provides a `reindex` command for this, but due to Postgres locks being placed on the index during this process, you may want to make use of the `concurrent` keyword.
```

1
reindex index concurrently idx_persons_age;

```

Alternatively you can reindex all indexes on a particular table:
```

1
reindex table concurrently persons;

```

Take note that `reindex` can be used inside a transaction, but `reindex [index/table] concurrently` cannot.
## Index Advisor[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/indexes#index-advisor)
Indexes can improve query performance of your tables as they grow. The Supabase Dashboard offers an Index Advisor, which suggests potential indexes to add to your tables.
For more information on the Index Advisor and its suggestions, see the [`index_advisor` extension](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/index_advisor).
To use the Dashboard Index Advisor:
  1. Go to the [Query Performance](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/advisors/query-performance) page.
  2. Click on a query to bring up the Details side panel.
  3. Select the Indexes tab.
  4. Enable Index Advisor if prompted.


### Understanding Index Advisor results[#](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/indexes#understanding-index-advisor-results)
The Indexes tab shows the existing indexes used in the selected query. Note that indexes suggested in the "New Index Recommendations" section may not be used when you create them. Postgres' query planner may intentionally ignore an available index if it determines that the query will be faster without. For example, on a small table, a sequential scan might be faster than an index scan. In that case, the planner will switch to using the index as the table size grows, helping to future proof the query.
If additional indexes might improve your query, the Index Advisor shows the suggested indexes with the estimated improvement in startup and total costs:
  * Startup cost is the cost to fetch the first row
  * Total cost is the cost to fetch all the rows


Costs are in arbitrary units, where a single sequential page read costs 1.0 units.
