# Display AI Apps in Slack
When an AI app is installed in Slack, workspace owners and admins can make its AI Agent available in the Slack desktop app, allowing all members to easily find and use it. The Agent appears in the top-right corner of Slack, and when multiple AI apps are installed, each member can customize which ones are shown there.
