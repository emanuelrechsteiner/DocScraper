Hacktoberfest is in full swing and we've been blown away by [all the incredible projects](https://supabase.com/blog/hacktoberfest-hackathon-winners-2021) submitted to our second open-source Hackathon.
We've picked our top ten favourite projects across five categories, and believe us, it was a tough decision to make!
Since all submissions were so stellar, we've decided to reward everyone with a [limited edition participation tee](https://supabase.store/products/hacktoberfest-participation-tee).
Now, let us introduce the winner and runner up for each category, and see below for the even more limited edition swag they've won!
Lastly, remember that all projects are open-source, so do check them out and spend the second half of Hacktoberfest contributing to your favourite projects!
