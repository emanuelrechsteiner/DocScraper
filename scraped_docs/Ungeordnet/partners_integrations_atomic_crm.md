## Overview
Atomic CRM lets you build the CRM that matches your company's vision.
It's both an **application template** , that you can use to get started quickly, and a **framework** that you can extend and customize to fit your needs.
It's built on Supabase, so it's super easy to host, and to extend with custom logic. The frontend is build with TypeScript, React, Material UI, Tanstack Query, react-hook-form, and react-admin.
## Features
Atomic CRM comes out of the box with all the features you'd expect from a CRM, such as:
  * **Organize Contacts** : Effortlessly organize and access all your contacts in one place, ensuring you have the right information at your fingertips.
  * **Create Tasks and Set Reminders** : Stay on top of your to-do list with easy task creation and automated reminders to keep you on track.
  * **Take Notes** : Capture important details and insights with our intuitive note-taking feature, making sure nothing gets lost.
  * **Import and Export Data** : Seamlessly transfer data in and out of the system with our simple import and export tools, making integration a breeze.
  * **Manage Deals** : Visualize and manage your sales process with our customizable deals pipeline, helping you track progress and close deals faster.
  * **Track Activity History** : Get a comprehensive view of all interactions, including emails, tasks, new deals and contacts, with aggregated activity logs.


It also comes with a set of **advanced capabilities** that will make your CRM stand out:
  * **Authentication** : Log in using your Enterprise Workspace account, including Google, Azure, Keycloak, and Auth0.
  * **Kanban Board** : Optimize your sales process with a customizable, drag-and-drop card system.
  * **Email to Note** : Include Atomic CRM in your email CC to automatically capture and save communications as notes.
  * **Contact Avatars** : Enrich contact details by letting the CRM automatically pull avatars from the web using their email.
  * **API Integration** : Tap into Atomic CRM's API to effortlessly integrate with other systems, providing a cohesive and unified data environment.
