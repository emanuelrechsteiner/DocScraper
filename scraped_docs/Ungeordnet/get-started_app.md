# Adding LLM Apps
**LLM App** is an application developed using a Large Language Model. You can integrate various LLM apps, such as OpenAI Assistant, GPTs, LangChain, or other Open LLM applications.
You can integrate LLM apps at [Assistants](https://runbear.io/assistants) page. The integration method would be slightly different based on frameworks or foundation models.
## Supported LLM Apps[​](https://docs.runbear.io/get-started/app#supported-llm-apps "Direct link to Supported LLM Apps")
  * **[OpenAI Assistants](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations/apps/openai-assistants)** : APIs provided by OpenAI. It allows you to build an LLM application without writing a single line of code using the OpenAI platform.
  * **[OpenAI GPTs](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations/apps/openai-gpts)** : Custom GPT builder provided by OpenAI. Although OpenAI does not offer APIs for GPTs, there is a workaround to integrate them with communication channels.
  * **[LangChain](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations/apps/langchain)** : The most renowned framework for developing applications powered by language models.
  * **[Python Application](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations/apps/python-sdk)** : Any LLM application built using Python can be integrated into Runbear.
  * **[Anthropic Claude](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations/apps/anthropic-claude/)** : Claude is one of GPT's capable competitors. According to Google-backed Anthropic, Claude outperforms the GPT models powering ChatGPT on several benchmark cognitive tests.
