## Testimonials
> I love Catalyst because I can gradually make it my own while using the stock defaults to quickly get something on the page. I also love that it lets me see how the creators of Tailwind CSS structure their components, so I (or my AI agents) can emulate their best practices.

Founder of [SavvyCal](https://savvycal.com)
> We’ve gone through several iterations of our pricing page recently, and every time we wanted to try a new idea I was able to find the perfect starting point in Tailwind Plus. It’s turned a project I might have never made the time to tackle into something I could finish and ship in an hour.

## Frequently asked questions
Everything you need to know.
### General
What does “lifetime access” mean exactly?
Buying a Tailwind Plus license is a **one-time purchase, with no recurring subscription**. When you purchase a Tailwind Plus license, you get access to everything in Tailwind Plus forever.
What does “free updates” include?
When you purchase a Tailwind Plus license, you get access to every component package and every site template available today, plus any additional component packages or templates we release in the future at no additional cost.
This means that if we add a brand new component package like “Journalism” or design a new social media website template, access to those products are included in your original purchase.
To get an idea of what updates have looked like in the past, [check out our changelog](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog).
Do you offer student or purchasing power parity discounts?
For situations where price is an issue, we offer a discounted restricted license you can purchase if either:
  * You are a student using Tailwind Plus purely for educational purposes, or
  * You are an individual using Tailwind Plus for commercial projects and your annual personal income from all sources **does not exceed $30,000 USD**


To purchase a discounted restricted license, email us at support@tailwindcss.com.
### Compatibility
Are Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD files included?
No, design assets for tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD are not included.
We don't produce high-quality design artifacts as part of our own design and development process, so building these extra resources means we can't spend as much time creating new components and templates in code which is where we believe we can provide the most value.
What JS framework is used?
Our [website templates](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates) are built using Next.js, so all of the markup is written using React.
Our [components](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks) are provided in three formats: React, Vue, and vanilla HTML.
The React and Vue examples are fully interactive, and are powered by [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev) — a library of unstyled components we designed to integrate perfectly with Tailwind CSS.
The vanilla HTML examples **do not include any JavaScript** and are designed for people who prefer to write any necessary JavaScript themselves.
Most of the components do not rely on JS at all, but for the ones that do (dropdowns, dialogs, etc.) we've provided some simple comments in the HTML to explain things like what classes you need to use for different states (like a toggle switch being on or off), or what classes we recommend for transitioning elements on to or off of the screen (like a dialog opening).
To get a better idea of how this looks in practice, [check out our documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/documentation#using-html).
What version of Tailwind CSS is used?
Everything in Tailwind Plus is designed and developed for the latest version of Tailwind CSS, which is currently Tailwind CSS v4.1.
What browsers are supported?
The components and templates in Tailwind Plus are designed to work in the latest, stable releases of all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
We don't support Internet Explorer 11.
### Licensing
Do I need to purchase a license for each project I work on?
Unlike most other templates/themes, you don't have to buy a new Tailwind Plus license every time you want to use it on a new project.
As long as what you're building is allowed as per the license, you can build as many sites as you want without ever having to buy an additional license.
For more information and examples, [read through our license](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/license).
Can I use Tailwind Plus for client projects?
Yes! As long what you're building is a custom website developed for a single client, you can totally use components and templates in Tailwind Plus to help build it.
The only thing you can't do is use Tailwind Plus to build a website or template that is resold to multiple clients.
For more information and examples, [read through our license](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/license).
Can I use Tailwind Plus for my own commercial projects?
Absolutely! Your license gives you permission to build as many of your own projects as you like, whether those are simple public websites or SaaS applications that end users need to pay to access.
As long as what you’re building isn’t a website builder or other tool that customers can use to create their own sites using elements that originate from Tailwind Plus, you’re good to go.
For more information and examples, [read through our license](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/license).
Can I use Tailwind Plus in open source projects?
Yep! As long as what you're building is some sort of actual website and not a derivative component library, theme builder, or other product where the primary purpose is clearly to repackage and redistribute our components, it's totally okay for that project to be open source.
For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our license](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/license).
Can I sell templates/themes I build with Tailwind Plus?
No, you cannot use Tailwind Plus to create derivative products like themes, UI kits, page builders, or anything else where you would be repackaging and redistributing our components or templates for someone else to use to build their own sites.
For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our license](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/license).
Can I upgrade to a team license later?
Yup! If you're a solo developer you can start with a regular license, and then upgrade to the team license later if other developers join your team.
There is an "Upgrade to Team License" option under the "Account" menu after logging in.
Can I purchase a team license that includes more than 25 seats?
In general, if you need more than 25 seats we recommend purchasing multiple team licenses — one for each team at your company who needs access.
For example, if you run an ecommerce business, you might purchase a team license for the storefront team, then down the road another team license for the marketing team, then another for the data science team, and so on.
If you need more than 25 seats because you're a large agency or other type of company that isn't really organized into separate divisions/teams, contact us at support@tailwindcss.com for large team pricing.
### Support
Do you offer technical support?
Tailwind Plus is a self-serve product, meaning that while we do offer customer support for things like account management and licensing related concerns, the expectation is that customers have the requisite knowledge of Tailwind CSS, HTML, React, and Vue to use the product successfully.
Because every project is different and the way independently authored pieces of code interact can be complex and time-consuming to understand, **we do not offer technical support or consulting**.
Tailwind Plus customers do get access to a private Discord community where you can ask questions and help others with their questions in return, but we don't offer first-party technical support or consulting here ourselves.
What is your refund policy?
If you're unhappy with your purchase for any reason, email us at support@tailwindcss.com within 30 days and we'll refund you in full, no questions asked.
