# Team Deputy
Teams often get slowed down by the same questions being asked over and over. A deputy bot can act like a smart helper, answering these common questions for you. This way, everyone can focus on their main work without getting distracted.
**TL;DR**
  * Create a Q&A bot designed to respond to questions using your team's knowledge.
  * Set it up to reply whenever you or your team are named in certain channels.

## Step-by-Step Guide[â€‹](https://docs.runbear.io/use-cases/team-deputy/#step-by-step-guide "Direct link to Step-by-Step Guide")
  1. Build a Q&A bot for you or your team. Follow the [Q&A Bot](https://docs.runbear.io/use-cases/qna-bot/) guide.
  2. Connect it to specific channels (e.g., `#people-team-qna`). Visit the [Integrations](https://docs.runbear.io/integrations) page to learn how to do it.
  3. While creating a new connection, turn on the **"Auto-Trigger by Keyword"** option.
  4. Copy the user ID or team ID of the communication channel. For example, you can copy a Slack user ID from the user profile pages. The Slack user ID looks like `U01234ABCDE`.
