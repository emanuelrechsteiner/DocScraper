## [API Reference](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text#api-reference)
This component is based on the `span` element and supports [common margin props](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/overview/layout#margin-props).
Prop| Type| Default  
---|---|---  
`as`Prop description| `"span" | "div" | "label" | "p"`| `"span"`  
`asChild`Prop description| `boolean`| No default value  
`size`| `Responsive<enum>`See full type| No default value  
`weight`| `Responsive<"light" | "regular" | "medium" | "bold">`| No default value  
`align`Prop description| `Responsive<"left" | "center" | "right">`| No default value  
`trim`Prop description| `Responsive<"normal" | "start" | "end" | "both">`| No default value  
`truncate`Prop description| `boolean`| No default value  
`wrap`Prop description| `Responsive<"wrap" | "nowrap" | "pretty" | "balance">`| No default value  
`color`Prop description| `enum`See full type| No default value  
`highContrast`Prop description| `boolean`| No default value  
## [Examples](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text#examples)
### [As another element](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text#as-another-element)
Use the `as` prop to render text as a `p`, `label`, `div` or `span`. This prop is purely semantic and does not alter visual appearance.
This is a **paragraph** element.
This is a **label** element.
This is a **div** element.
This is a **span** element.
```

<Text as="p">This is a <Strong>paragraph</Strong> element.</Text>

<Text as="label">This is a <Strong>label</Strong> element.</Text>

<Text as="div">This is a <Strong>div</Strong> element.</Text>

<Text as="span">This is a <Strong>span</Strong> element.</Text>


```

### [Size](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text#size)
Use the `size` prop to control text size. This prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacing—as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease.

Sizes 2–4 are designed to work well for long-form content.
The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant. The question is: What proportion(s) will give us the best results? The golden ratio is often observed in nature where beauty and utility intersect; perhaps we can use this “divine” proportion to enhance these attributes in our typography.

### [Weight](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text#weight)
Use the `weight` prop to set the text weight.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
```

<Text weight="regular" as="div">

 The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

</Text>

<Text weight="medium" as="div">

 The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

</Text>

<Text weight="bold" as="div">

 The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

</Text>


```

### [Align](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text#align)
Use the `align` prop to set text alignment.
Left-aligned
Center-aligned
Right-aligned
```

<Text align="left" as="div">Left-aligned</Text>

<Text align="center" as="div">Center-aligned</Text>

<Text align="right" as="div">Right-aligned</Text>


```

### [Trim](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text#trim)
Use the `trim` prop to trim the leading space at the start, end, or both sides of the text box.
The prop works similarly to the upcoming [half-leading control](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#leading-trim) spec, but uses a common [negative margin workaround](https://seek-oss.github.io/capsize/) under the hood for cross-browser support.

<Flex direction="column" gap="3">

<Text
		trim="normal"

			borderTop: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
			borderBottom: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}

<Text
		trim="both"

			borderTop: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
			borderBottom: "1px dashed var(--gray-a7)",
		}}
	>

		With trim

</Text>

</Flex>


```

Trimming the leading is useful when dialing in vertical spacing in cards or other “boxy” components. Otherwise, padding looks larger on top and bottom than on the sides.

The default trim values are configured for the system font stack that’s used by Radix Themes. If you are using custom fonts, you can [adjust](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/theme/typography#customization) the trim values using the corresponding CSS variables.
```

.radix-themes {

	--default-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;

	--default-leading-trim-end: 0.36em;

	--heading-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;

	--heading-leading-trim-end: 0.36em;

}


```

### [Truncate](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text#truncate)
Use the `truncate` prop to truncate text with an ellipsis when it overflows its container.
The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant.
```

<Flex maxWidth="300px">

<Text truncate>

		The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width

		in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and

		more pleasant.

</Text>

</Flex>


```

### [Wrap](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text#wrap)
Use the `wrap` prop to control text wrapping.
The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant.
```

<Flex maxWidth="270px">

<Text wrap="nowrap">

		The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width

		in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and

		more pleasant.

</Text>

</Flex>


```

```

`text-wrap: pretty` is an experimental value that is [not yet supported in all browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-wrap#browser_compatibility). However, it can be treated as a progressive enhancement for browsers that do support it.
### [Color](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text#color)
Use the `color` prop to assign a specific [color](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/theme/color). The text colors are designed to achieve at least Lc 60 APCA contrast over common background colors.

</Text>

```

### [With formatting](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text#with-formatting)
Compose `Text` with formatting components to add emphasis and structure to content.
Look, such a helpful [link](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text), an _italic emphasis_ , a piece of computer `code`, and even a hotkey combination `⇧⌘A` within the text.
```

<Text as="p">

	Look, such a helpful <Link href="#">link</Link>, an <Em>italic emphasis</Em>,

	a piece of computer <Code>code</Code>, and even a hotkey combination{" "}

<Kbd>⇧⌘A</Kbd> within the text.

</Text>


```

### [With form controls](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/text#with-form-controls)
Composing `Text` with a form control like [`Checkbox`](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/checkbox), [`RadioGroup`](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/radio-group), or [`Switch`](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/switch) automatically centers the control with the first line of text, even when the text is multi-line.
I understand that these documents are confidential and cannot be shared with a third party.
