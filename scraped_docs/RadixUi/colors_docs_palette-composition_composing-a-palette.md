# Composing a color palette
A guide to composing a color palette with Radix Colors.
## [Choosing a brand scale](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/composing-a-palette#choosing-a-brand-scale)
Radix provides a number of scales you could use for your brand or accent color.
Scales designed for white foreground text:
bronze
gold
brown
orange
tomato
red
ruby
crimson
pink
plum
purple
violet
iris
indigo
blue
cyan
teal
jade
green
grass
Scales designed for dark foreground text:
sky
mint
lime
yellow
amber
### [Custom brand colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/composing-a-palette#custom-brand-colors)
Radix Colors are not intended to be customised. They’re designed to be accessible, well-balanced, and harmonious. Any customisation would likely break these features.
If you need custom brand colors, we recommend adding custom scales alongside Radix scales.
For example, you could use Radix Colors for your gray scale and your semantic scales, then add custom brand/accent colors.
## [Choosing a gray scale](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/composing-a-palette#choosing-a-gray-scale)
Radix Colors provides a pure gray and a few tinted gray scales.
gray
mauve
slate
sage
olive
sand
  * `gray` is pure gray
  * `mauve` is based on a purple hue
  * `slate` is based on a blue hue
  * `sage` is based on a green hue
  * `olive` is based on a lime hue
  * `sand` is based on a yellow hue


### [Neutral pairing](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/composing-a-palette#neutral-pairing)
If you want a neutral vibe, or you want to keep things simple, `gray` will work well with any hue or palette.
### [Natural pairing](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/composing-a-palette#natural-pairing)
Alternatively, choose the gray scale which is saturated with the hue closest to your accent hue. The difference is subtle, but this will create a more colorful and harmonius vibe.
mauve
tomato
red
ruby
crimson
pink
plum
purple
violet
slate
iris
indigo
blue
sky
cyan
sage
mint
teal
jade
green
olive
grass
lime
sand
yellow
amber
orange
brown
Note: If your project uses a lot of colorful UI components like Badge, be careful when using saturated grays for your app background, especially in dark mode. Colorful UI components may clash with your saturated gray background color.
## [Choosing semantic scales](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/composing-a-palette#choosing-semantic-scales)
For most projects, you will need colors to communicate semantic meaning. Here are some common pairings that work well in Western culture.
  * **Error** : `red`, `ruby`, `tomato`, `crimson`
  * **Success** : `green`, `teal`, `jade`, `grass`, `mint`
  * **Warning** : `yellow`, `amber`, `orange`
  * **Info** : `blue`, `indigo`, `sky`, `cyan`


In many cases, you might eventually need most of the scales, for one reason or another. Your app may support multiplayer mode, where you assign a color to each user. Your app may have a labelling feature, where your users assign a color to a task. Your app may use badges to communicate “pending” or “rejected” states.
Radix Colors are well-balanced, and designed to work in harmony. So for product communication, most color pairings will work.
## [Choosing text scales](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/composing-a-palette#choosing-text-scales)
Steps 11 and 12 are designed for low-contrast text and high-contrast text respectively. Depending on the vibe you want, you can use your accent scale or your gray scale.
Using your accent scale will result in a more colorful vibe.
This text is Blue 12
Using your gray scale will result in a more functional vibe.
This text is Slate 12
The difference may seem subtle, but it can make a huge difference with a whole page of text.
You may want to experiment with using your accent scale for text in your marketing sites, and your gray scale for text in your apps.
