Case study
# Linear
> We’ve adopted several Radix primitives so far and we can see that it significantly improved our accessibility compliance, removed a lot of complexity from code, and allowed us to focus on what we do best: UI and UX.
**Describe the type of project you are using Radix Primitives on?**
We started using Radix Primitives for some parts of our design system—Orbiter—which is used in Linear’s web and desktop applications. Our design system is still under active development. We carve out pieces of code from the application and try to make them reusable and generic components.
**In what ways have Radix Primitives helped you and your company?**
We’ve adopted several Radix primitives so far and we can see that it significantly improved our accessibility compliance, removed a lot of complexity from code, and allowed us to focus on what we do best: UI and UX.
We plan to continue Radix Primitives adoption and replace our current implementation of checkboxes, switches, radios, dialogs, etc. Using all these primitives should make our design system much simpler and way more accessible.
**What are your thoughts on Radix developer experience?**
It’s just great. We particularly like that you can compose primitives as you want or create more abstractions on top of them. Since we’re adopting Radix primitives one by one, it’s important for us that Radix has separate NPM packages for each component so the bundle footprint is minimal and we don’t need to care about tree-shaking optimizations.
When it comes to styling, we use styled-components and it was a really straightforward experience to combine it with Radix. A clear separation of styling and behavior allows to create different visual variations of a single component with ease.
Community is important too. The Radix team is super responsive and helpful, they gave us a couple ideas and workarounds for our Select implementation.
**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**
It’s well written with great examples that you can copy and paste or play around with in Codesandbox just in one click.
Beside that we really appreciate having a clear and detailed [Releases](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/primitives/docs/overview/releases) page.
