Case study
# Basedash
> With Radix Primitives, we can now implement new components in minutes and ship them within a day. This lets us spend more engineering resources on our core product.
**Describe the type of project you are using Radix Primitives on?**
We’re using Radix Primitives to build a custom design system for our main app at Basedash. The project is live with regular users who use the app daily. We have 2 engineers working regularly on the design system, in addition to expanding core functionalities of the app.
**In what ways have Radix Primitives helped you and your company?**
Before adopting Radix Primitives, we shied away from building complex components like alerts and context menus for fear that they would take days of development to get right. With Radix Primitives, we can now implement new components in minutes and ship them within a day. We rarely have to think about accessibility because Radix handles it so well out of the box. This lets us spend more engineering resources on our core product.
**What are your thoughts on Radix developer experience?**
The Radix component APIs are incredibly slick. Super simple out-of-the-box, but fully customizable if needed. One of the main reasons we chose Radix is because the components are unstyled. This is huge for companies building their own component library⁠—no more wrestling with default library styles, we can apply our own styles exactly how we want.
**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**
The docs are some of the best we’ve worked with. They’re complete with full type definitions for each prop which are incredibly useful when working in a TypeScript codebase. They include lots of examples (including a live interactive component), and documentation on accessibility which is nice.
