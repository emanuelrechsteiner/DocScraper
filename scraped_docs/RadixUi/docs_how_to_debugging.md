# How to debug your LLM apps
Like building any type of software, at some point you'll need to debug when building with LLMs. A model call will fail, or model output will be misformatted, or there will be some nested model calls and it won't be clear where along the way an incorrect output was created.
There are three main methods for debugging:
  * Verbose Mode: This adds print statements for "important" events in your chain.
  * Debug Mode: This add logging statements for ALL events in your chain.
  * LangSmith Tracing: This logs events to [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) to allow for visualization there.

## Tracing[‚Äã](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/debugging/#tracing "Direct link to Tracing")
Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).
After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:
```
export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="..."
```

Or, if in a notebook, you can set them with:
```
import getpassimport osos.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"]="true"os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"]= getpass.getpass()
```

Let's suppose we have an agent, and want to visualize the actions it takes and tool outputs it receives. Without any debugging, here's what we see:

We don't get much output, but since we set up LangSmith we can easily see what happened under the hood:

## `set_debug` and `set_verbose`[‚Äã](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/debugging/#set_debug-and-set_verbose "Direct link to set_debug-and-set_verbose")
If you're prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks or running Python scripts, it can be helpful to print out the intermediate steps of a chain run.
There are a number of ways to enable printing at varying degrees of verbosity.
Note: These still work even with LangSmith enabled, so you can have both turned on and running at the same time
### `set_verbose(True)`[‚Äã](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/debugging/#set_verbosetrue "Direct link to set_verbosetrue")
Setting the `verbose` flag will print out inputs and outputs in a slightly more readable format and will skip logging certain raw outputs (like the token usage stats for an LLM call) so that you can focus on application logic.

Setting the global `debug` flag will cause all LangChain components with callback support (chains, models, agents, tools, retrievers) to print the inputs they receive and outputs they generate. This is the most verbose setting and will fully log raw inputs and outputs.

Philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson wrote that \\\"Inception became a classic almost as soon as it was projected on silver screens\\\", praising its exploration of philosophical ideas, including leap of faith and allegory of the cave.[97] The film grossed over $836¬†million worldwide.[98] Nominated for eight Academy Awards‚Äîincluding Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay‚Äîit won Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects.[99] Nolan was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Director, among other accolades.[40]\\nAround the release of The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Nolan's third and final Batman film, Joseph Bevan of the British Film Institute wrote a profile on him: \\\"In the space of just over a decade, Christopher Nolan has shot from promising British indie director to undisputed master of a new brand of intelligent escapism. He further wrote that Nolan's body of work reflect \\\"a heterogeneity of conditions of products\\\" extending from low-budget films to lucrative blockbusters, \\\"a wide range of genres and settings\\\" and \\\"a diversity of styles that trumpet his versatility\\\".[193]\\nDavid Bordwell, a film theorist, wrote that Nolan has been able to blend his \\\"experimental impulses\\\" with the demands of mainstream entertainment, describing his oeuvre as \\\"experiments with cinematic time by means of techniques of subjective viewpoint and crosscutting\\\".[194] Nolan's use of practical, in-camera effects, miniatures and models, as well as shooting on celluloid film, has been highly influential in early 21st century cinema.[195][196] IndieWire wrote in 2019 that, Nolan \\\"kept a viable alternate model of big-budget filmmaking alive\\\", in an era where blockbuster filmmaking has become \\\"a largely computer-generated art form\\\".[196] Initially reluctant to make a sequel, he agreed after Warner Bros. repeatedly insisted.[78] Nolan wanted to expand on the noir quality of the first film by broadening the canvas and taking on \\\"the dynamic of a story of the city, a large crime story¬†... where you're looking at the police, the justice system, the vigilante, the poor people, the rich people, the criminals\\\".[79] Continuing to minimalise the use of CGI, Nolan employed high-resolution IMAX cameras, making it the first major motion picture to use this technology.[80][81]\"}]" ]}[36;1m[1;3m[llm/end][0m [1m[1:chain:AgentExecutor > 11:chain:RunnableSequence > 16:llm:ChatOpenAI] [20.22s] Exiting LLM run with output:[0m{ "generations": [  [   {    "text": "The 2023 film \"Oppenheimer\" was directed by Christopher Nolan.\n\nTo calculate Christopher Nolan's age in days, we first need his birth date, which is July 30, 1970.
