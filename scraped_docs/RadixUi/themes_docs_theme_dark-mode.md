# Dark mode
Using appearance to manage and integrate dark mode.
## [Overview](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/theme/dark-mode#overview)
Light and dark modes are supported out of the box, allowing you to easily switch appearance without additional design or styling.

## [Basic usage](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/theme/dark-mode#basic-usage)
By default, the root `Theme` appearance is `light`. To set a different appearance pass it via the `appearance` prop. This will force the theme to use the specified setting.
```

<Theme appearance="dark">

<MyApp />

</Theme>


```

## [Inheriting system appearance](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/theme/dark-mode#inheriting-system-appearance)
A common requirement is to inherit the appearance setting from a user’s system preferences.
This is a deceptively complex problem to solve given SSR, SSG and client side hydration considerations. To make implementation easier, we recommend integrating with a theme switching library.
### [With next-themes](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/theme/dark-mode#with-next-themes)
Integration with `next-themes` is simple and straightforward because Radix Themes implements matching class names.
To enable dark mode, use `<ThemeProvider>` from `next-themes` with `attribute="class"`.
```

import { Theme } from "@radix-ui/themes";

import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";

export default function () {

	return (

		<ThemeProvider attribute="class">

<Theme>

<MyApp />

</Theme>

</ThemeProvider>

	);

}


```

**Do not** try to set `<Theme appearance={resolvedTheme}>`. Instead, rely just on class switching that `next-themes` provides. This way `next-themes` can prevent the appearance flash during initial render.
### [With other libraries](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/theme/dark-mode#with-other-libraries)
Any library that supports class switching is compatible. You’ll just need to ensure that the appended class names match those supported by Radix Themes:
  * `className="light"`
  * `className="light-theme"`
  * `className="dark"`
  * `className="dark-theme"`
