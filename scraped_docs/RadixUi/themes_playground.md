Versions of the _Lorem ipsum_ text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. It is typically a corrupted version of _De finibus bonorum et malorum_ , a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin.

"A man who would letterspace lower case would steal sheep," Frederic Goudy liked to say. The reason for not letterspacing lower case is that it hampers legibility. But there are some lowercase alphabets to which this principle doesn’t apply. Moderate letterspacing can make a face such as lowercase Univers bold condensed more legible rather than less

Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and aesthetics. Although in a non-technical sense “legible” and “readable” are often used synonymously, typographically they are separate but related concepts.
Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as “the quality of being decipherable and recognisable”. For instance, if a “b” and an “h”, or a “3” and an “8”, are difficult to distinguish at small sizes, this is a problem of legibility.
Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is their job to select the correct font to use. Brush Script is an example of a font containing many characters that might be difficult to distinguish. The selection of cases influences the legibility of typography because using only uppercase letters (all-caps) reduces legibility.

The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant. The question is: What proportion(s) will give us the best results? The golden ratio is often observed in nature where beauty and utility intersect; perhaps we can use this “divine” proportion to enhance these attributes in our typography.
