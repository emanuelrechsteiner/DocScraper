# Styling
Radix Primitives are unstyled—and compatible with any styling solution—giving you complete control over styling.
## [Styling overview](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/styling#styling-overview)
### [Functional styles](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/styling#functional-styles)
You are in control of all aspects of styling, including functional styles. For example—by default—a [Dialog Overlay](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/dialog) won't cover the entire viewport. You're responsible for adding those styles, plus any presentation styles.
### [Classes](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/styling#classes)
All components and their parts accept a `className` prop. This class will be passed through to the DOM element. You can use it in CSS as expected.
### [Data attributes](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/styling#data-attributes)
When components are stateful, their state will be exposed in a `data-state` attribute. For example, when an [Accordion Item](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/accordion) is opened, it includes a `data-state="open"` attribute.
## [Styling with CSS](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/styling#styling-with-css)
### [Styling a part](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/styling#styling-a-part)
You can style a component part by targeting the `className` that you provide.
```

import * as React from "react";

import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";

import "./styles.css";

const AccordionDemo = () => (

	<Accordion.Root>

<Accordion.Item className="AccordionItem" value="item-1" />

{/* … */}

</Accordion.Root>

);

export default AccordionDemo;


```

### [Styling a state](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/styling#styling-a-state)
You can style a component state by targeting its `data-state` attribute.
```

.AccordionItem {

	border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;

}

.AccordionItem[data-state="open"] {

	border-bottom-width: 2px;

}


```

## [Styling with CSS-in-JS](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/styling#styling-with-css-in-js)
The examples below are using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), but you can use any CSS-in-JS library of your choice.
### [Styling a part](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/styling#styling-a-part-1)
Most CSS-in-JS libraries export a function for passing components and their styles. You can provide the Radix primitive component directly.
```

import * as React from "react";

import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";

import styled from "styled-components";

const StyledItem = styled(Accordion.Item)`
 border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
`;

const AccordionDemo = () => (

	<Accordion.Root>

<StyledItem value="item-1" />

{/* … */}

</Accordion.Root>

);

export default AccordionDemo;


```

### [Styling a state](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/styling#styling-a-state-1)
You can style a component state by targeting its `data-state` attribute.
```

import { Accordion } from "radix-ui";

import styled from "styled-components";

const StyledItem = styled(Accordion.Item)`
	border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
	&[data-state="open"] {
		border-bottom-width: 2px;
	}
`;


```

## [Extending a primitive](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/styling#extending-a-primitive)
Extending a primitive is done the same way you extend any React component.
```

import * as React from "react";

import { Accordion as AccordionPrimitive } from "radix-ui";

const AccordionItem = React.forwardRef<

	React.ElementRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>,

	React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>

>((props, forwardedRef) => (

	<AccordionPrimitive.Item {...props} ref={forwardedRef} />

));

AccordionItem.displayName = "AccordionItem";


```

## [Summary](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/styling#summary)
Radix Primitives were designed to encapsulate accessibility concerns and other complex functionalities, while ensuring you retain complete control over styling.
For convenience, stateful components include a `data-state` attribute.
